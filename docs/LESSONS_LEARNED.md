# Lessons Learned

Updated: 2026-09-19

1. A restored DB is not automatically production-ready.
Verify owner/auth, project ownership, N8N_PATH, editor URL, webhook URL, and asset paths before cutover.

2. user-management:reset changes auth state.
It preserved workflows and credentials but returned the instance to owner setup. Only use it with an explicit owner re-creation plan.

3. Wrong N8N_PATH can produce a white UI.
Root HTML pointed to /recovery assets and the browser received wrong content for JavaScript. Production root must use N8N_PATH=/ and asset paths must be verified after changes.

4. Do not run duplicate n8n servers on one DB.
Recovery and root must never be active against the same restored single-instance database.

5. A foreign whole .env is not a fix.
The clean shorts-v2 compose was temporarily pointed at a recovery .env and inherited the wrong encryption-key state. shorts-v2 must use only its own .env.

6. n8n volume config can preserve a stale encryption key.
Even after compose was corrected, /home/node/.n8n/config still contained the key created under the bad recovery environment. Inspect the config first; do not blindly replace project secrets.

7. Exit code 0 is not proof of a DB mutation.
A heredoc sent to docker exec without -i did not reach psql. Always verify post-counts and exact IDs.

8. Do not touch unrelated n8n.
n8n.hodor.com.pl is unrelated. publisher.hodor.com.pl contains MCP/business workflows that must remain intact.

9. Google Cloud TTS historically worked.
The August backup proves repeated successful Cloud TTS executions with the selected voices. The restored OAuth is currently expired and needs reconnect; that is a credential-validity issue, not proof the provider never worked.

10. Gemini TTS is not production TTS.
Production narration remains Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.

11. Historical visual failures were systemic.
Too few images and generic loosely related assets are unacceptable. Every shot needs visual intent, must-show/must-not-show, multiple search queries, multi-source discovery, deterministic ranking, and fail-closed relevance.

12. Human review is final.
Machine PASS is provisional. Only explicit HUMAN PASS accepts the exact final MP4.


13. Restoring credentials into the intended production n8n determines where orchestration belongs.
The 9 credentials were restored into `publisher.hodor.com.pl` so the video project could use them there. Creating another n8n afterward defeats that work and creates unnecessary OAuth, routing, authentication and encryption-key problems.

Prevention:
- production video orchestration stays in `publisher.hodor.com.pl`;
- MCP/ADMIN workflows remain protected by exact identity;
- supporting services may be isolated, but production n8n/credentials stay in publisher;
- no new n8n domain or second production n8n without a proven technical blocker and explicit user approval.
